# Greenhouse_Plant_Growth Analysis with Model Prediction
Advanced IoT-Based Smart Greenhouse Dataset (Agriculture Growth Monitoring).

# About Dataset
The Advanced IoT Agriculture Dataset captures detailed physiological and morphological measurements of plants grown under two greenhouse settings (IoT‑enabled vs. traditional) at Tikrit University’s Agriculture Lab. Compiled by Mohammed Ismail Lifta (2023–2024) under the supervision of Prof. Wisam Dawood Abdullah, it comprises 30,000 records spanning 14 variables that quantify chlorophyll levels, growth rates, biomass (wet/dry weight), root metrics, and more, alongside a final categorical Class label.

# Aim of the Project:
"Can we accurately predict greenhouse type and analyze plant growth patterns using environmental sensor data, 
and how do machine learning techniques help in understanding the impact of IoT on crop health and productivity?"

# Steps to follow:
 **To analysis:**
 - Average of chlorophyll in the plant for both IoT and Traditional green house
 - Average plant height rate for both IoT and Traditional green house
 - Average wet weight of the growth vegetative for both IoT and Traditional green house
 - If their is any influence that can have effect on both Green house types.
